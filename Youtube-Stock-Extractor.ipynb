      "five stocks I'm buying now March 2024 Edition welcome in folks to my favorite video I do for you guys each and every month where we're going to cover the stocks that I'm buying in the current month and why I'm buying these stocks we're also going to cover the prices that I'm looking to acquire these stocks at versus uh let's call stop buying these stocks as well all I ask in return is that you smash that like button here today and you make sure you're subscribed here to the channel that's all I ask in return for this video here today folks if you want to enjoy a free Workshop after this video is over pin comment down there that's going to go into how much money you need to retire quit your job those sorts of subjects that's absolutely free that's pin comment down there and without further Ado folks let's just get into this we got to get into all five of these stocks in this video here today let me know in the comment section if you own on any of these stocks you're interested in any of them i' love to hear from you guys okay first stock of the five stocks up here is Sofi Technologies this is a stock that today is trading at $7 and some change let's call it the low sevens now Sofi technology this is a position I'm looking to start actually in my public account here and um I want to actually start to likely acquire some Sofi shares pretty aggressively now at this point in time and the reason being is I've seen a lot of very fundamental changes in the business model that are let's just call adding up for a potential huge increase in the stock price here so if we look at the company's net interest income net interest income arguably the most important metric people will look at when it comes to judging a bank rated company right so net interest in come from December 2020 through December 2023 went from about $177 billion to over $1.2 billion in this latest year is climbed substantially so this is a very strong Growth Company now simultaneously operating income went from $432 million in the negative okay that's an operating loss of $432 million in December in the December 20121 ended year there this most recent year they only took an operating loss of 53 3 million but here's something much bigger very recently as in this past quarter the company just flipped to actual operating income now the company just had a positive operating income of $51 million now the reason that is so massive is for sofi's basically entire existence this company's always been a company that was just had big operating losses quarter in and quarter out and so people kind of shocked Sofi stock up as it's just yeah it's a fast Growth Company okay they're acquiring a bunch of members they're acquiring a bunch of customers they're growing their revenues okay okay okay they're just a big money losing company well that has all changed now at this point in time in the previous quarter you got a little hint you got a little sniff that oh maybe this company's going to flip over to actual positive operating income and sure enough they did it the last quarter $51 million I mean look at some of the losses they were taking operating losses 144 million in that quarter there $107 million in that quarter there so this is a huge step in the right direction and from where management team is kind of been guiding this company now it looks like the company's going to stay operating income positive moving forward which is a huge deal for this company okay now not only are they operating income wise positive but also net income positive as well now at this point in time so no longer can Sofi stock be chocked up as a huge money losing company oh they just burn money they money that is no longer factual in regards to Sofi this is now starting to become a money making company which let's be honest no one really wants to own a bank that loses money right everybody wants to own a bank that actually makes money I mean you're in the banking business you should be making some dang money right no in regards to this company there's a big debate about is the stock cheap or is it expensive and the reason being is if you look at the Ford P based upon 2025 estimates the company's trading at about you know 39 times that Year's expected number now if you look at traditional Banks they're usually trading at let's call it 7 to about 12 times forward PS if you look at a year or two out so Sofi is trading massively over that right but but look at this total interest in dividend income went from 355 million in the in the 2021 year to this past year over $2 billion right that's over 5x and then net interest income 5x about as well right 252 million to 1.2 billion plus it's about another 5x and that's just in a couple years so the comp no one's growing like that in the banking system if you compare them to a Wells Fargo or Bank of America or JP Morgan or or any of those guys Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs whoever you want to compare them with I mean you can't even it's not even in the same Stratosphere as far as growth goes so you can't even begin to Value this company anywhere remotely close to where you would value a Wells Fargo or a Bank of America or JP Morgan Chase or any of those other guys okay the growth is unreal in regards to Sofi so when I look at the company overall I see a company that's actually likely trading pretty cheap considering the growth rates even if I don't think they're going to continue to grow 5x you know these sorts of growth rates but what do I think is a realistic growth rate for the company moving forward I believe a realistic growth rate for the company moving forward is anywhere between 15 and 25% a year and I I think they'll be able to do that year in year out for pretty much the next decade maybe they'll have one freak year where they don't do it but I think 15 to 25% a year for the next 10 years is realistic and you know you just look at them versus other traditional Banks and they're just not even in the same Stratosphere right so if you're going to have a massive Growth Company then you're going to have to pay up and so that's the way it works in regards to a company like Sofi the other thing needs to be considered is it's very possible 15 analysts have those numbers for 2025 23 cents right could be low those numbers could be low right if we look at this latest quarter Sofi came in they beat by $22 million in terms of Revenue they also beat EPS by 2 cents which is actually a substantial beat on a percentage basis right that's massive so imagine SOI continues to knock out the ballpark come in and beat beat beat numbers is's a very high potential that maybe this number is way way too low and maybe next year's number is way too low as well and they'll do far better than that no when you buy a bank you are you've got to put a lot of trust in the CEO now when you buy any stock in general you're putting a lot of trust in the CEO CEOs can completely ruin a company they can completely change the trajectory of a company forever and that company can become you know 10x 100x THX opportunity right Anthony notto I've got to say he's really grown on on me as a CEO I listen to this man in many interviews now at this point in time on conference calls I'm very impressed very impressed with Anthony Noto and also if you look at his pedigree I mean my gosh he was a managing director at Goldman Sachs he was a CFO of the NFL he's also Co of Twitter the man's got a man's got a very impressive very impressive background behind him and so I think this is a type of conservative man I'm looking for in terms in terms of who I want guiding a bank overall right now there's only two other Banks I've ever owned uh since I've been in the public markets one of them is JP Morgan Chase and you know one of the reasons I invested in that bank wasn't just the valuation it was also Jamie Diamond and I looked at him and I said man this guy's you know he he's he can get this company through any storm you know recessions inflation deflation doesn't matter what's going on in the world he's going to get that bank through into the other side and they're going to emerge stronger than when they went in and they're going to likely take advantage of market share opportunities out there and that's what JP Morgan Chase does time in and time out and the only other bank I've ever owned is Goldman Sachs which is an investment bank right and when it comes to Goldman Sachs I own that back in the days of Lloyd link find and he was just you know a phenomenal phenomenal CEO there at at uh you know Goldman Sachs so you've got to put trust in the CEO and I feel very very comfortable with Anthony notto now the stock price has crashed massively and the reason the stock price has crashed massively is and let me share my opinions on this but it's a big deal basically the company is planning to sell up to $862 million in convertible bonds the online financial services company will offer $750 million in convertible senior notes due March 2029 and buyers will have the option to purchase $112 million more so if I said will use part of the proceeds to pay for Capp call options to limit the dilution to shareholders of the convertible Bond offering now obviously you know investors aren't happy about this in the short term right but I I go back to a decision like this and I say I put this in this man's hands I believe he knows much more than me in regards to why this is a smart decision and so whenever you own a bank you've got to trust the big dog in charge if you can't trust them then you can't own it at the end of the day I believe Anthony notto is looking at this and he thinks this is absolute no-brainer smartest decision the company can make for the long-term of the company and I'm right there with it and so I looked at something like this today and I say okay everybody can sell the stock off and freak out over this I think Anthony notto is making the right decision here and that's regardless of what my personal opinion is on it I just got to feel comfortable in that if once again if you can't feel comfortable in the CEO in in in a bank you can't be in that bottom line okay now when it comes to Sofi it's about it's a little baby market cap on this company about a $7 billion market capitalization right in the way I look at Sofi I think this company can become a giant over the next decade a banking giant okay and what are we talking about when we're talking about banking Giants well this is the list I think sofa is going to be on if we look out 10 years from now and I'll show you the justification why I think they're going to get on to this list 10 years from now okay you know you look at the biggest banks market caps JP Morgan Chase 5 100 billion plus Bank of America 278 billion Wells Fargo 202 billion HSBC 148 billion Morgan Stanley 145 billion when I think about those sorts of companies right I think about companies that were able to attract massive amounts of customers across many different price points and and offer tons of products to those folks over many many decades right and what I see in Sofi is everything that should line them up to become a absolute giant over the next decade where they're on a list like this and they're the type of company that's a 50 billion 100 billion 150 billion dollar type company over time when I look at this company here's why members which is just a fancy way of saying customers right look at their customer count if we want to go back to Q4 2021 they're at about 3.4 million members now they're up to over 7.5 million members look at this quarter in and quarter out they grab more members more members more members right incredible products also up substantially so when I look at this company I'm like okay they're going to go to 10,000 or excuse me they're going to go to 10 million plus then they're going to go 20 million 30 million 40 million 50 million and continue to attract especially a lot of the younger generation that they might be in their lower income earning days but they're going to climb as years Take Along and and go along right and then this is worth noting because not a lot of people talk about this Galileo so Galileo if you want to talk about their Tech side of the company right and out of side of just traditional banking Galileo has shown a lot of Promise they're up to 145 million Galo accounts now at this point in time so that business obviously continues to grow quite substantially so when I look at Sofi over here kind of what am I thinking about for Buy price and those sorts of things basically my my view is scooping up anything under 10 bucks I'm going to try to get my hands on as as much as I can here in the short term under $10 the one thing that worries me is going through a big sort of um you know financial crisis type situation with a with a stock like Sofi cuz they haven't been through that yet right this would be their first rodeo but listening to Anthony notto talk he sounds extremely conservative also him having the his experience at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs gets through everything Goldman Sachs there's a reason Goldman Sachs has been around since like a long long dang time and meanwhile everybody else on Wall Street goes out of business and Goldman Sachs somehow makes it through every single time right they got a different DNA over there the way they risk adjust is is unparalleled right he has that Goldman Sachs pedigree he has Chief Financial Officer pedigree as well and so I believe he's one that can get through whatever potential storms are in the future and he's already shown he got the company through Rona he also got the company through the whole student loan for forgiveness situation that the company had to go through for several years he's had to get the company through a lot and yet the company gets bigger bigger and bigger and bigger now getting a profitability so I like what I see here with Sofi and so yeah U you're going to likely see me start to buy it actually in the public account which is that's the Holy Grail man when you get in there it's a big deal it's a big flip and flapjacking deal so SOI I like it I like it a lot okay all right guys let's get into the next one which is Nike just do it Nike easy easy easy money oh is Nike going to be easy money over this next 5 years so Nike excuse me Nike Nike Nike Nike is a stock that I mean it can't get out of its own way for the past year and to be honest the past 5 years is is really pathetic for the stock overall Nike stock is up a whole whopping 13% in the past 5 years now I look back at past time periods the only 5year run I could really find in Nike's history that was bad like this was 2007 through 200 it had a really rough run during that particular time and um sure enough it's having one of those sorts of runs right now it's on it's it's been really tough for the company but you've got to diverge in the stock market between what's going on short term versus long term especially for somebody like myself it's a long-term investor I plan to buy stocks over months or potentially years right and I hold those stocks many of those stocks for many times months or usually years and years and years and years right there stocks I hold the the public count that I've held since 2018 2019 years and years and years right and so I'm always thinking in the longterm and I love what I see here for the long term for Nike Nike's got one of the strongest brands in the world right the only clothing company that has that sort of strong brand the closest thing would be Louis Vuitton but Louis Vuitton put more into the accessories category than a clothing company right and I mean you look at the list on you know anytime you're up there and your Brand's almost as powerful as a Coca-Cola and a Google and Amazon and and apple these sorts of companies that's that's on a whole other level right so with Nike the brand so successful and the brand so great the world is their potential customer and because they have price points that are realistic for much of the world it's one of the very few companies that can sell to the world there's not that many when you really think about how few companies can sell the world McDonald's can sell to the world right it's that famous of a brand their products are cheap enough they can do it YouTube Instagram Facebook WhatsApp products like that even those ones actually can't sell the world because China limits actually their business where uh Nike can actually operate in China right because of I don't want to get into that whole situation but you know how many few how it's amazing how few companies can really realistically sell to the whole world Nike is one of the few that can do it right no they recently announced they're going to cost cut in a huge way they're going to do about a $2 billion cost cutting plan right and a lot of that's going to end up straight back down to the bottom line of this company and it's something they do have to do now when I look at analyst expectations analysts for next year are at about keep in mind Nike's fiscal year ends at a weird time it ends in May basically analysts have them doing 422 I have them doing $450 to $5 in in the May 2025 and it fiscal year there so 23 forward p is fair even if analysts are right there but I think analysts are too low so I think I'm getting this stock for a far lower valuation than where anals have it at no if I think about competition right cuz competition always is is something that comes up whenever you got to look into any company right if I think about the competition here's what we're looking at okay if you want to put them against you know another shoe company like an all birds okay all birds latest quarter their revenue is down you know 21 plus% net loss of $31 million who knows if that company's even going to be around in a few years or if they'll be BK right there's a company named Noble I never heard of this company but I was I was under the weather this weekend so I was watching a bunch of the NFL combine right n combines like this workout all you know the future NFL players all go through and there there's this brand I see it's sponsored all over they must paid a fortune to sponsor the combine called Noble and the whole time I didn't even know what the brand was I'm like noble okay cool like I don't know what it is and uh I had to ask my wife I said you know there's noall brand and she's like oh yeah I know that brand cuz if some people wear it at the gym I go to and I was like oh okay so it's like and she's like oh yeah they make some shoes and stuff like that to me told me that company has no clue what they're doing the fact that I watched that combine over several days and they never ran enough advertisements to even like oh oh that's what that company is it's a shoe company okay they they're for workouts and things like that I'm just like they're clueless over there Adidas right they just had their big breakup this past year with with uh you know the whole yeey situation so I don't know how that's going to turn out so Adidas is a mess as far as that goes under armour they're a mess that stock if you go back 10 years ago that stock was $27 $28 stock is8 bucks here today right so under aror is just a complete mess so competition is is a joke it's always been a joke they have competition that props up and all of a sudden it looks like woo and then they you know they always screwed up that's just I've watched this game play out for 30 plus years now they all all their competitors always screwed up somehow they really do they'll get hot for a bit and then they just can't sustain it nei's the only one that sustains it throughout time right no it might seem like man Nike just buys the biggest athletes because it just seems like all the biggest name most famous most successful athletes are all Nike athletes right and some of that is true but the one thing I will say is the company doesn't just spend to spend right they'll they'll cut losses when they got to cut losses for instance they ended the the Tiger Woods partnership recently right I mean Tiger Woods is just not what Tiger Woods once was 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago right I mean it's just it's a whole different game so you know that that relationship ship ended right uh Steph Curry they didn't sign Curry right but at the end of the day and you might say that was a loss I think it was more of a loss for curry and I think a lot of people have probably watched you know this deal Curry would have been so much better off if he just signed with Nike so much better off he would have probably made way more money in his Under Armour deal he got a bunch of the stock well no one even wants Under Armour stock they're selling you can't even you know you have trouble selling it for nine bucks so even if he wants to dump his Under Armor stock good luck doing that and meanwhile n finessed the whole deal because meanwhile when when Curry goes out there to shoot his shots has Nike emblems all over him right so Nike really got the last laugh I look at a guy like bolt bolt really messed up by not signing with Nike so I think people see not signing with Nike and they realize oh damn you know we should just sign with Nike we get way better marketing so the way I look at Nike it's got this massive moat around it competitors come and go in this game all the time and shoe companies come and go all the time and at the end of the day Nike is the only one who sustains generation in and generation out and grows stronger time in and time out and on the up Cycles Nike benefits the most and on the down Cycles Nike does the best as well you see these other companies have revenues down 20 30 40% and meanwhile Nike might be flat or revenues down very slightly so Nike love it as a long-term investor I need to be buying that one number three of five oh boy here we go Tesla my Esla oh yeah baby so Tesla as of today's trading about $180 a share stocks down about 9% in the past year if you're new to my channel I've been a Tesla shareholder for a long time okay before everybody jumped in this bandwagon I've been on this this this uh I've been in this car for a while and it's a roller coaster ride of a stock it really is the highs are really high in regards to Tesla and it just seems like there's no top and the lows are really low and just to be quite Frank over the last year or so we've been going through a lot of lows in regards to Tesla for really a year and a half two years now at this point in time it's been you know just seem like ah there just always bad news always bad news once you get good news is too bad news to you know kind of override it at the end of the deal keep it simple okay they got the strongest product lineup in the game from the luxury side to the midsize side with a three in the Y they've got the semi in the market now and then cyber truck starting a ramp with Robo taxi coming right they got the strongest product lineup out there they also have the coolest you know maybe the coolest brand of any brand in the world I mean who else is doing this you see these celebrities I mean I'm not just talking about celebrities I'm talking Mega celebrities like the biggest celebrities are like driving the Cyber truck around right this is great they said uh you know Elon must you responded to somebody said well they clearly have great taste important to note that no one receives a discount in including me and no one is paid to promote our products this is these Mega celebrities going out of their way the lady gagas and the Jay lenos and Serena Williams and Kim Kardashian and farell and Justin Bieber and all these people right are going out of their way to drive the Cyber truck because it is that cool and at the end of the day they know if they take that out that's the coolest vehicle doesn't matter what Lamborghini you got doesn't matter what your Rolls-Royce is or your Bentley is at the end of the day the coolest person is the person who pulls up in the Cyber truck it will be the one that gets all the attention you got an Aventador it's just another Aventador you got a big boy rolls calling in it's just another one you got a cyber truck oh my gosh bring out the cameras that's the bottom line in regards to that right now shortterm we've got things working against us interest rates are high Chinese economy is bad margins are low which by the way Tesla's margins even reach recently are actually really good compared to most auto companies just for Tesla standards they're low so the thing is you got to ask yourself are these the things that are is the Chinese economy always going to be bad I don't think so are interest rates always going to be high I don't think so are Tesla's margins always going to be low I don't think so those are all fixable things over the long term meanwhile look what we have going for the long term EV adoption is going to continue the internal combustion engine is on its way out like there's no debating that it's on its way out out it doesn't happen all in a day but over the coming years going to be less and less and less of those on the road and more and more EVs and every time you're going to look at the data it's going to say more EVS less less internal combustion engines self-driving vehicle adoption is going to continue autonomous taxi networks are coming it's not like that we're just going to go pass that and like oh no that's never going to happen no that's coming just wait on it battery cost continues to drop the company is still scaling several factories I mean you you know you would have thought 5 years ago they had already scaled up Fremont to Max potential and yet somehow year and year out they blow the numbers out the water so they's still scaling in China they're still scaling in in Europe they's still scaling in Austin right and then when Mexico comes online they're going to be scaling Mexico company is still young in the margin story that's other thing people got to understand like Tesla is so young as a company I mean this company wasn't even at scale 5 years years ago like they really just got to scale in like the last 3 years specific right and so you know this is very young in the margin story they got a lot of 5 10 15 20 years of margin to capture here okay this is you know everybody gets so caught up in the year-by-year changes it's like I'm worried about where Tesla margin are 10 years from now Services is going to grow into a giant over this next decade I mean when you think about the service opportunity from the supercharger Network to you know maintenance of vehicles or maintenance of a fleet or you know things that break on vehicles and inapp purchases uh satellite maps self-driving capabilities I mean my gosh the services opportunity is is unparalleled and that's going to grow into a giant and it will start to be respected as a giant but it's going to take a while to get there no different than Apple Services was not respected for a long time and apple Services really started getting respect about you know four or 5 years ago and so Tesla Services probably four or five years from now everybody's going to be look at that and be like wow this business is huge I keep watching that number grow and grow and grow and I'm like how's no one paying attention this this is like the story for me Tesla will continue to out inovate their competition by a mile if you want to even call them their competition but not only will Tesla continue to out innovate their competition they're going to continue to out innovate almost anybody that you even want to put in the same sentences him they've got one of the top CEOs in history at the company I mean you know who's done more than than him out there that's amazing right Elon Musk and they got one of the most talented motivated workforces in the history of mankind and so these are all things that are longterm all going in the right direction for Tesla so when I look at this story I say yeah the short term that sucks man those things those things really hurt but when I think about the next 10 20 years I'm like those things look pretty flipp and Flapjack and good there now I like Tesla stock under $200 I love the stock under $150 if it can go under 150 ooh man then we're really really talking in regards to this one so I'm I'm kind of hoping for more short-term weakness but I'm not that confident I'm not that confident because I do think the management team could could signal a a bottom in margins within the next few months and if they do that then the stock could actually start to to move up quite rapidly because then everybody would be like oh margin Bottoms in and you know things would start to roll from there so Tesla I like Tesla fourth of these five stocks buying March 2024 look at this whirlpool whol yes I want to start a position here in Whirlpool stocks done horrible over the past 5 years and really over the past few years here right you might say what the heck are you doing messing around with a washer and dryer company you kidding me are you talking stoves are we talking dishwashers are we talking refrigerators and freezers and microwaves and hand mixers what in the world's going on I like money I like money okay I see money I see Arbitrage here and if there's money I want to go toward it so Whirlpool just got kicked out of the S&P 500 so I think the stock there's a decent probability could go under 100 here in the short term it got replaced with super micro yeah I'm not surprised um and so that's a that's a huge short-term kind of bad thing for warpool stock price which I'm looking at it as somebody that wants to start a position I'm like this is perfect absolutely perfect here's a deal okay existing home sales are pretty much around where they were in the Great financial crisis and you know the only time it was worse in the great financial crisis the housing crash was in a few little shortterm spans there but actually for much of the the GFC housing bust it was actually even better than it is right now I don't think we're going much lower than here for existing home sales I think this is bottom is territory now I don't want to call a bottom what specific month but we're in bottom is territory that's what I'll say about that which is going to bode very well cuz when people buy a new home you know decent probability they might buy a new washer dryer refrigerator oven things like that and that bodess very well for Whirlpool right the stocks trading dirt cheap I mean you know seven times this year's expected numbers that's dirt cheap for this company and they did beat very nice on EPs and revenue last quarter so overall Whirlpool is it the most exciting company in the world no but it's a dirt cheap stock I see an Arbitrage here I see a potential to make a double up on the stock over the next few years assuming I'm right and we bot them out existing home sales this year and that starts to move up over the next few years then I think whirpool can go from kind of like a $100 to maybe a 200 maybe have a you know double up opportunity there while making dividend money you know it's not as it's not as uh sleepy as it might seem let's just call it that okay there's there's something there I'll put it like that okay uh last stock up here of the bunch number five of five is cake you know I love cake Cheesecake Factory to the the house baby this one I've been buying very aggressively the past few months I'm up to 1,2 323 shares in the public account it's also one of my biggest positions in the patreon portfolio and uh yeah I've spoken about that one quite extensively last month on the six stocks I'm buying Now video so if you want to hear me talk about cake check out that video there you can search it on my Channel or just search it on YouTube or also there's this video I put out that looks like 56,000 people have gotten a chance to see from 2 weeks ago nine stocks to buy now equal to stealing money if I recall cake was one of the stocks talked about in that video there so you know you can obviously find that on YouTube no problem just type in that or go to my channel whatever you
